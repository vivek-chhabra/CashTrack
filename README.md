**CashTrack is a web application that allows users to keep track of their daily transactions.

## üåü Features

- User authentication: The application requires users to sign up and log in to access its functionalities. This ensures that each user can only view and manage their own transaction data.

- Add transaction: Users can input the transaction name and amount and click the "Add Transaction" button to add a new transaction. The transaction is then displayed on the left side of the home page.

- Delete transaction: Each transaction card includes an "x" mark icon at the top right corner. By clicking this icon, users can delete the corresponding transaction from their records.

- View transaction date: Users can click on a transaction card to toggle between viewing the transaction name and the date when the transaction was created. This allows users to easily track the dates of their transactions.
